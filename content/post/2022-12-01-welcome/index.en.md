# Title Example
This is a very brief post to welcome you to my website. I will be using this to share my journey into data as well as a way to document the concepts I learn. There is tons to learn when it comes to programming and Data Science, good documentation can make that process easier.

## Code Example

```r
x <- 2 * 2
y <- 4

if (x == y){
  print("true")
} else{
  print("false")
}
```

```
## [1] "true"
```

### Subheading

#### Where is the toc

## I want the TOC
