## Is starting a Kickstarter Campaign worth it?

This project uses SQL to analyze a database of [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) campaigns to determine if starting a campaign is the right decision for a business.Additionally, Tableau is used to create colorful visuals. For the sake of analysis, this project has been designed with the perspective of providing insights based on the data and so recommendations are tailored to a specific category rather than overall campaign advice.
